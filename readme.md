Learning journal for various pluralsight and other studies in coding. Files are usually modified multiple times, completely changing. Use git history to see contents but mostly useless since it's done to cement knowledge.

For python, version 3.12.3 was mainly used. Switch to or create venv and use pip install -r requirements.txt for needed modules. "Needed" modules are any that are required to run any code here. Like so:

python3 -m venv venv (or whatever path/folder name you want to create)
source venv/bin/activate (or if on windows, source venv/Scripts/activate)

Files often don't follow course exactly, instead modifying with what makes sense with ever changing knowledge. Done to both cement the knowledge (if you work with it in your own way, you'll actually have to think instead of copying what someone else is doing) and to better the code (often teachers don't account for things outside the scope. So go outsisde the scope/box and see what you can do).

Also, ideally in code you should never have commented code or even long comments. They are included here to demonstrate thought process and for reference, no different than showing your process on a long math problem.
