Learning journal for various pluralsight and other studies in coding. Files are usually modified multiple times, completely changing. Use git history to see contents but mostly useless since it's done to cement knowledge. Switch to venv and use pip install -r requirements.txt for needed modules. Like so:

python3 -m venv venv (or whatever path/folder name you want)
source venv/bin/activate (or if on windows, source venv/Scripts/activate)
