This project is a continually incrementing one to track my learning in Javascript. The goal is to showcase what I've picked up via Pluralsight paid courses of JS in their JS pathway.

We use lite-server for development to have code update as soon as it's changed to avoid constant refreshing. The node-modules are here but if need be, package contains enough to just run "npm install" and the script to run the server via localhost is "npm run dev"
