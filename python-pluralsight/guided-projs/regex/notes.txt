Folder structure doesn't match demo

import re module for regex. Use r'' (raw string) for easier, don't have to keep escaping chars
Use the pattern with re. Get results via match.group(). bool(match) can be used as validation (did we return None)
re.match starts at start of string. re.search searches entire string.
\d - 0-9
\w - a-z, A-Z
\s - white space
\S - Any non-whitespace char
+ - one or more, like \d+
? - zero or one
* - zero or more

{n} - do this many times (1 would be the same as not having this)
(pattern) - group pattern.

Ex (\w+\s){2} to do that whole pattern twice (1 or more alphas followed by space)
Ex (\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3} can match IP, as it does 1-3 digits followed by '.', do that group 3 times, then final 1-3 digits

When using re.findall, if you use groups, will return list of tuples of the group matches.
To just get the main match (the first ele), you'd have to make as a group the entire pattern
Then do [i[0] for i in re.findall(pat,str)]. It seems silly to need to do this, another way?
